Welcome to the Karna user guide! This guide will help you understand how to play the game, its various controls, and how to deal with any issues that might occur. 


## Getting Started

Our game does not require the user to login or enter any information.

Karna can be run and played directly from GameMaker. To do so, navigate to the Karna.yyp file in the KarnaGameFiles folder, right click, and click open with GameMaker.



## Gameplay

The objective of Karna is to kill all of the enemy characters that are facing off against you, and to ultimately take down the final boss, who is more familiar to you than you think...

Karna takes place in the dreams of our titular protagonist, as he faces off against foes. The initial room leads to more rooms that are navigable. 


When opening the game, the title screen will help the player navigate.

## Controls

In the game, you can move up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

Karna attacks using his divine bow and arrow when you left click with the mouse. Holding down left click will continously fire his weapon.

Karna can dash away and towards enemies by hitting the space bar. There is a short cooldown for this mechanic.



## Troubleshooting

- Game won't run due to missing asset/object
If the game throws an error regarding a missing object or file, please delete your current copy of Karna and download a complete and up to date version from the repository according to the instructions.
